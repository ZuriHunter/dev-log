- Unity is going to discontinue support for MonoDevelop. MonoDevelop is an IDE for C#, F# and many more languages.  They are going to switch to having developers use their preferred IDE or Visual Studio.  I am not too much of fan. But I will have to tailor the tutorial for anyone who wants to make a change to the unity-sdk to whatever they wish.

- **QT**
  - I don't have Atlas installed on here but I want to look into using QT with Atlas...for fun.
  - It is a cross-platform application framework and widget toolkit for creating classic and embedded graphical user interfaces and application that run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.  It remains as a native application with native capabilities and speed.
  - Open Source and Commercial are offered.
