- Unity is going to discontinue support for MonoDevelop. MonoDevelop is an IDE for C#, F# and many more languages.  They are going to switch to having developers use their preferred IDE or Visual Studio.  I am not too much of fan. But I will have to tailor the tutorial for anyone who wants to make a change to the unity-sdk to whatever they wish.
