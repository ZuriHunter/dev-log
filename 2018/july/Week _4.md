- Today I learned about this https://alf.nu/RegexGolf A website that gives puzzles on how to use Regex with text.  I use to fear regex and always run from it when I was presented a problem that required it. But today I feel a little better about it now.  The idea is to find the common pattern in all of the text and work your way backwards.
